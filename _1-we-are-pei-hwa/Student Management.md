<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px;font-family:sans-serif;">In Pei Hwa, we believe in positive discipline where we teach children to develop safe, socially responsible behavior that promotes self-discipline, self-respect and respect for the feelings and property of others.<br><br>Students are expected to be familiar and comply with the school rules and regulations listed&nbsp;here.</p>


<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-family:sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">School Rules and Regulations</h4>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">1. General Conduct</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Student must:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:5px">
	<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;font-family:sans-serif;"> Be courteous at all times. Offensive language will not be tolerated;
</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5 ;margin-top:5px; font-family:sans-serif;"> Show respect to all school staff, visitors to the school and peers. Rudeness and
defiance will not be tolerated;
</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5 ;margin-top:5px; font-family:sans-serif;"> Be considerate to others; and
</li>
	<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5 ;margin-top:5px; font-family:sans-serif;"> Take good care of school property.
</li>
	</ul>


<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">2. Daily Assembly and Punctuality</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;font-family:sans-serif;">The daily practice of singing the National Anthem and reciting the Pledge are some ways in which we seek to show respect and rootedness to our country.</p> 

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;"><strong>Students who are Singapore Citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist placed over the heart. </strong>Non-
citizens must stand at attention during the singing of the National Anthem and Pledge-taking. Solemnity and respect must be observed at all times. </p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Students must assemble at the quadrangle/ classroom before 7.30am (Mondays to
Fridays) for the flag-raising and pledge-taking ceremony. Students are encouraged to be in school at least 5 minutes before 7.30am. Students who are not at the quadrangle/ classroom after the bell rings at 7.30am will be considered late for school.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Latecomers must collect a Late-coming Slip from the General Office. Students without the Late-coming Slip will not be allowed to join the class.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Latecomers will be sent for detention on the 4th late-coming offence. If late-coming continues, parents will be notified and will have to meet the HOD Student Management. Students will face stricter disciplinary measures as well.</p>


<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">3. Attendance</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Students who are absent from school and scheduled activities, such as Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and remedial, must submit a valid medical certificate on the day of return
to school. If this is not complied with, the absence will be treated as truancy. A letter from
the parent is not acceptable unless the absence is due to valid family matters, such as medical appointments, external examinations, court proceedings or a death in the family. Truancy is a serious offence and consequences can include detention and school suspension.</p> 

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;"><strong>Parents/students should call the school’s General Office at 65009580 by 8.00am on the same day of absence to inform the school of the student’s absence.</strong></p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Students are not allowed to leave the school premises during school hours. However, permission to leave school early may be granted for special cases. Permission must be obtained from the Principal, Vice-Principals and HODs.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Students are discouraged from leaving Singapore during term time.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">A student who is unwell in school must report to the General Office. Parents will be
contacted to come to school to take him/her home.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">4. Positive Learning Attitude and Homework</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Students learn better with a positive learning attitude, demonstrated by:</p>

</li>
	</ul>
	
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Students are responsible for finding out what they have missed during their absence from
class as soon as possible and completing the classwork and homework accordingly.
Students who do not establish a positive learning attitude for themselves by following the
above guidelines will face consequences such as reporting to the teacher after school
hours to complete the work, detention, having their parents called and/or meet the HODs
and Year Heads.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">5. Student Movement</strong></p>

<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Adjust&nbsp;your bicycle to fit</strong>. Make sure your legs are fully extended when you are pedalling.</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Check your equipment</strong>. Check that tyres are inflated properly and ensure that brakes are working.</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">See and be seen</strong>. Always wear bright colours when riding. Also wear something that reflects light, such as reflective tape or markings, or flashing lights. Remember, just because you can see a driver, doesn’t mean the driver can see you.</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Maintain control over your bicycle</strong>. Always ride with at least one hand on the handlebars. Carry books and other items in a bicycle carrier or backpack.</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Watch out for&nbsp;road hazards</strong>. Be on the lookout for hazards such as potholes, humps, broken glass, gravel and puddles. All these hazards can result in a nasty fall.</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Avoid riding at night</strong>. It is more dangerous to ride at night than during the day because visibility is usually poor at night. If you have to ride at night, wear something that makes you visible. Make sure you have reflectors on the front and rear of your bicycle.</li>
