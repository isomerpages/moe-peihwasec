<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">Founded in 2006, the Pei Hwa Alumni (PHA) is an organization consisting of graduates from their alma mater, Pei Hwa Public School. The Youth Wing of PHA (PHAYW) was formed in 2008 for graduates from Pei Hwa Secondary School.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:Open Sans;">PHAYW serves as a platform for graduates of Pei Hwa Secondary School to remain connected to the school, and to continue their contributions to the community. The Youth Wing strives to be self-driven and be community based, with the aim to be the PRIDE of the Pei Hwa family.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:Open Sans;">Since its inception, PHAYW strives tirelessly to contribute to the development of students in Pei Hwa Secondary School by working closely with the school in programmes like Senior Citizen Day, our biennial Community Day, Food from the Heart Charity Drive and Education Career Guidance Day. Our Youth Wing members also shares with and mentors their juniors in schools through various platforms made available, like the annual leadership camps and through the various CCAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:Open Sans;">As a form of recognition to the Youth Wing, scholarships are awarded through Pei Hwa Foundation to outstanding Alumni who have done well in their respective institutions of education and had also contributed to the Pei Hwa Family through different platforms.</p>
