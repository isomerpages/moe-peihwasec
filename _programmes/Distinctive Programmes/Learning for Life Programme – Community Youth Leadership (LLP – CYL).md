<p><strong>CYL Experiences:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sec 1: School Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Students work in groups to implement school improvement projects with the use of micro:bits. They use the design thinking process to find out the needs of the school, brainstorm for ideas and create solutions to meet the needs.</p>
<p><strong>Sec 2: Create Tokens for VWOs</strong></p>
<p>Students work in groups to create tokens with the use of micro:bits, that meet the needs of adopted VWOs. They use the design thinking process to find out the needs of the VWOs, brainstorm for ideas and create solutions to meet the needs.</p>
<p><strong>Sec 2: Good and Green Neighbour (G2 Neighbour)</strong></p>
<p>Students go around the Fernvale Estate to collect newspapers and old clothing for recycling (Green). By being involved in the Good and Green Neighbour Level VIA, we hope to raise community awareness of recycling and care for the environment. We also hope to instill a sense of social responsibility in our students (Good).</p>
<p><em>G2 Neighbour was suspended in 2020 and 2021.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sec 3: Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP)</strong></p>
<p>The Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP), an initiative of Council for Third Age (C3A), aims to promote lifelong learning and to forge intergenerational bonding between the youth and the elderly.</p>
<p>Pei Hwa Secondary works with Family Central (FC), the organiser for the ILP, in having the students to teach the elderly a particular topic/skill. Through interaction, the youth learn important values and life lessons while the elderly gain new knowledge and skills.</p>
