<h4><strong>Our Goals</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Aligned to the school&rsquo;s mission &ldquo;To Develop Innovative and Compassionate Citizens&rdquo;, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to empower students with the technological and thinking skills that will enable them to be innovative and empathetic members of the community. As the Zonal Lead School for Making, we also strive to benefit our students with maker education and to initiate maker activities beyond our school for students in the North zone.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:2;">Website + Stemnovation + Exposure/Exhibition</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Our ALP has been enhanced and synergised with the collaboration with LLP and the various academic subjects to equip our students with future ready skills to succeed in the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) world.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">In Pei Hwa, we&nbsp;value the needs and interests of our students. Hence, we have also customized our programmes to stretch the potential of students with higher readiness and higher levels of interest in Robotics and Programming.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:2;"><strong>Project Work</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin-top:5px;">Anchored upon the PHSS Innovation Cycle, Project Work, which is part of the lower secondary curriculum, has integrated the existing signature school programmes (ALP and LLP) to allow students to develop their 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;CC skillsets and to facilitate their application of subject-based knowledge in a real world context.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Deserving projects are also recognized in various platforms:</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Presentations and sharings at external platforms such as Edutech Asia, SG:Digital Wonderland and Singapore Maker Extravaganza.</p>

<img src="/images/roboalp1.png" style="width: 100%;margin-top:10px;"  />

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Projects sent for competitions such as Tech for Good Challenge and SG:D Techblazer Awards (Student Techblazer).</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:2;"><strong>Stemnovation&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin-top:5px;">Stemnovation provides students with a week of immersion in STEM and innovation. Not only do students get to participate in a level wide making challenge with their classmates, they can also sign up for learning journeys, speaker series and making activities.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:2;"><strong>Maker Monday</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin-top:5px;">Maker Monday is an interest group which allows students to experience making and tinkering. Having a maker culture&nbsp;not only gives our students an edge in their future endeavours, but also enables our students to experience the joy of learning and be more confident and creative.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:2;"><strong>Pei Hwa Hackathon</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">As we get our students ready for their future endeavours, we believe that it is important for our students to share their skills and knowledge with the community too. Pei Hwa Hackathon is thus a competition held for our cluster&rsquo;s primary school students with the aim of enhancing their coding and problem solving skills. This is an opportunity for our students to be trained as assistant maker coaches. These selected students will be trained to facilitate and troubleshoot during the Hackathon. It is also a platform for them to hone their leadership skills as they lead and guide the different groups of primary school students.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; line-height:2;"><strong>Pei Hwa Virtual Hackathon 2021 [NEW]</strong></p>

<img src="/images/PH_hackathon-1024x637.jpg" style="width: 100%;margin-top:10px;" >

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Covid-19 has rocked the world in a way that no other global event has done before. In one fell swoop, a virus has managed to impact countless lives around the world. Many lives have been lost, others have been badly affected. No one has been left unaffected by Covid-19.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">More than ever before, innovation and creativity needs to take centre stage to come up with solutions to problems that have never been seen before. This is so that people can live their lives confidently, without fear.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Fully embracing the spirit of Covid-ence, the Hackathon organizing committee has decided to role-model our competition theme and take our Hackathon fully online. Participants will get to immerse themselves in the Hackathon experience remotely.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Participants are to develop and showcase Micro:bit innovations that could support societies in managing / tackling a pandemic. This will be made possible via virtual platforms such as video conferencing tools and online tutorials. Furthermore, all the components needed for participants to start their projects will be mailed to their respective schools to minimize contact.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">All this will not only protect our participants by maintaining social distancing, it will allow us to save time without shortchanging our participants&rsquo; learning.</p>
