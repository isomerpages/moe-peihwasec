<h4><strong>Our Goals</strong></h4>
<p>Aligned to the school&rsquo;s mission &ldquo;To Develop Innovative and Compassionate Citizens&rdquo;, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to empower students with the technological and thinking skills that will enable them to be innovative and empathetic members of the community. As the Zonal Lead School for Making, we also strive to benefit our students with maker education and to initiate maker activities beyond our school for students in the North zone.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>Website + Stemnovation + Exposure/Exhibition</p>
<p>Our ALP has been enhanced and synergised with the collaboration with LLP and the various academic subjects to equip our students with future ready skills to succeed in the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) world.</p>

<p><strong>Project Work</strong></p>
<p>Anchored upon the PHSS Innovation Cycle, Project Work, which is part of the lower secondary curriculum, has integrated the existing signature school programmes (ALP and LLP) to allow students to develop their 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;CC skillsets and to facilitate their application of subject-based knowledge in a real world context.</p>
<p>Deserving projects are also recognized in various platforms:</p>
<p>Presentations and sharings at external platforms such as Edutech Asia, SG:Digital Wonderland and Singapore Maker Extravaganza.</p>

<p>Projects prototyped in school.</p>
<p><strong>Stemnovation&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Stemnovation provides students with a week of immersion in STEM and innovation. Not only do students get to participate in a level wide making challenge with their classmates, they can also sign up for learning journeys, speaker series and making activities.</p>
<p><em>Experiencing STEM beyond the boundaries of the classroom</em></p>
