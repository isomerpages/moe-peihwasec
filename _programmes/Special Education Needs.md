<ul style="margin-top:5px;">
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:Open Sans;">individual / small group intervention support (e.g. in literacy skills);</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:Open Sans;">small group skills training (e.g. social skills, study and organizational skills);</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:Open Sans;">in-class support;</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:Open Sans;">case management and other administrative duties; and</li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-left:17px;font-family:Open Sans;">resource management</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:Open Sans;">Their scope of work includes collaborating and communicating with parents, teachers (including teachers trained in Special Needs (TSNs)), and other school personnel such as the school counsellors, to provide holistic support to students with mild special educational needs (SEN). They also work closely with external partners for consultation and diagnoses.</p>
