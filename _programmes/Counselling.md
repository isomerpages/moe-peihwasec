<p><strong>The Counselling Process</strong></p>
<p>Counselling is an interaction with a trained professional, and the purpose is to help you develop a better understanding of yourself and gain insight into issues you might be facing. In the process, you are encouraged to express your thoughts and feelings so that the counsellor can help you discover your strengths and weaknesses, and explore with you on solutions to your problems. You will then be able to make better decisions.</p>
<p>The counsellor is bound by professional ethics to main confidentiality of matters discussed during counselling sessions.</p>
<p><strong>The Referral Process</strong></p>
