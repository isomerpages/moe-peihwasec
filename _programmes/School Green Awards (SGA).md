<p>As part of the Pei Hwa&rsquo;s mission to nurture our students to become compassionate citizens who show care for the environment, the school has put in place varied platforms to increase environment awareness and action among the students and staff. These include infusing environment awareness into classroom lessons, allowing students to wear multiple hats to understand climate change from different perspectives during our signature Pei Hwa Chat sessions, as well as environment themed Assembly programmes and inter-class competitions facilitated by our Student Councillors, who are also Green Advocates.</p>
