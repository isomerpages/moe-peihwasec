<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-weight:bold">What is Direct School Admission?</h4>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">DSA-Sec is an initiative by MOE which was introduced in 2004 to give schools greater flexibility in student admission, so as to recognise more diverse range of student achievements and talents. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, participating schools may select some students for admission via their own admission criteria.</p>
