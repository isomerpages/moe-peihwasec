<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-weight:bold;font-family:Open Sans;">Our Goals</h4>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">In Pei Hwa Secondary School, we aim to develop Compassionate, Innovative and Daring leaders. Anchored by the school&rsquo;s PRIDE values, the student leaders will learn the various socio-emotional competencies through leadership development platforms and opportunities available in school. The Student Leadership program develops critical thinking, events management, and problem solving skills.</p>

<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-weight:bold;font-family:Open Sans;">Our Programmes</h4>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">We adopt the Student Leadership Challenge Model by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner in the development of the Student Leaders. Guided by the 5 practices of an exemplary leader, student leaders are trained during various platforms and given opportunities to serve the school.</p>

			<td style="font-family:Open Sans;margin-bottom:5px;">
The Student Council aims to develop innovative, daring and compassionate leaders. As Tier 3 Student Leaders, the Student Council is the voice of the student body and takes the lead in school events and improving student welfare. Student Councillors are also advocates of the environment by raising awareness about environment conservation through events such as Earth Week.
						<br><br>
						Every year, Student Councillors are officially appointed during the Student Leaders Investiture. As role-models of the student population, Student Councillors lead by example. They are given multiple platforms to develop their leadership and event management skills through organising events such as the Teachersâ€™ Day Celebration and Secondary 1 Orientation, as well as managing the PHun Lounge (Student Activity Center). Through reflection of their experiences, the Student Councillors are equipped with knowledge on leadership, teamwork and project management.
