<p style="font-size:15px;"><strong>Pei Hwa Art Council</strong>&nbsp;is a visual arts CCA which aims to provide students with opportunities to grow creatively. Students are exposed to a mix of fine art and design skills such as drawing and painting, ceramics and digital art to allow them a hands-on at trying out different media. They are also given opportunities to showcase their strengths and talents by participating in various competitions and Values in Action in order to give back to the community.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Outcomes</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Competitions and CCA Activities</strong></h4>
<p>PHAC tries to strike a balance between learning new skills, taking part in competitions, supporting school events and in giving back to the community. Our recent participation was &lsquo;Draw My Stamp Story Art Competition&rsquo; organised by Singapore Philatelic Museum (SPM) to help students understand and appreciate the importance of designs reflected on our Singapore stamps. Previously, we also took part in the Live On Design Competition which included a Values in Action segment for students to be able to have an insight into the lives of patients and donors. We also put our artistic skills to good use by creating silkscreen designs on tote bags as part of our CCA&rsquo;s efforts in raising funds for our school&rsquo;s adopted voluntary welfare organisations during Community Day 2019. When we are not busy taking part in competitions, we have fun going on learning journeys and camps to recharge and learn new skills.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Testament</strong></h4>
<p>&ldquo;It has been an honour serving as the president of Pei Hwa Art Council. PHAC has enabled me to develop my artistic and creative skills through trying out different mediums and artforms such as watercolour, digital media and ceramics. The process of creating an artwork is thrilling and I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I complete a piece, especially when I can bring it home for keepsake. PHAC has allowed me to use my creativity in other ways to develop my leadership skills like planning games and activities for my CCA mates. It&rsquo;s great to see everyone having fun and bonding together at PHAC.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pei Hwa Art Council exposed me to multiple forms of art such as ceramics, watercolour and digital drawings. I enjoyed being able to host a bunch of activities and games for my members to enjoy and seeing them have fun while being able to hone their artistic abilities. Being in PHAC not only helped me improve in Art, but also it helped me to grow as a leader too.&rdquo;</p>
