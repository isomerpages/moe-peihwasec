<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>

<p style="font-size:15px;">The Student Council aims to develop innovative, daring and compassionate leaders. As Tier 3 Student Leaders, the Student Council is the voice of the student body and takes the lead in school events and improving student welfare. Student Councillors are also advocates of the environment by raising awareness about environment conservation through events such as Earth Week.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;">Every year, Student Councillors are officially appointed during the Student Leaders Investiture. As role-models of the student population, Student Councillors lead by example. They are given multiple platforms to develop their leadership and event management skills through organising events such as the Teachers&rsquo; Day Celebration and Secondary 1 Orientation, as well as managing the PHun Lounge.</p>

	"Student Council provided me with a safe space to experiment various methods in leading a team, and I thoroughly enjoyed having an opportunity to work together with all sorts of people with vastly different backgrounds and leadership styles. This exposure has helped me gain a better perspective and grasp of leadership to develop my skills, alongside the support of my fellow Councillors. The opportunity to attend many events, such as leadership camps and external conventions has enabled my personal growth immensely through meeting and working with other like-minded individuals. To connect, impact and influence the rest of the school community is a large responsibility that gave me purpose and drive to serve as a Student Councillor. <br>
	I have learnt how to be quick-thinking and adaptable in the challenges I face. Taking charge of planning large scale projects such as the Secondary 1 Orientation, and assisting my fellow Councillors in events such as Teachers&rsquo; Day or Earth week have been invaluable experiences that let me grow in my management and communication skills. Through Council, I have become a more effective communicator, through giving clear instructions and providing direction to my teammates, especially when problems arise. Council has enriched my schooling experience and made it more worthwhile by pushing my capabilities further than what I had anticipated, and enabled me to become a well-rounded and confident leader."

	"The Student Council allows me to make new friends with peers from different levels and it allows me to experience skills that a normal student would not have the privilege to do, but it also makes me think of the school and how I can use this privilege I have to make changes that benefits everyone in the school.<br>
	I learnt many things in Council and one of the few is being in charge of a specific sub group for an event. It allowed me to learn how I should be a leader and how I should distribute the work so everyone plays their part in the planning of the event. Another thing I learnt is to speak confidently in front of the school from being the emcee of our school&rsquo;s Teachers Day Celebration which allowed me to develop the skill of public speaking. I think that Student Council helps to bring out a part of you that hasn&rsquo;t been found and that will be found as we go through different events."
