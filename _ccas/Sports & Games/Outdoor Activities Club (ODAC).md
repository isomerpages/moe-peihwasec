<p>Outdoor Activities Club (ODAC) exposes our members to various water sports such as kayaking and dragon boating and as well as climbing activities. Students will go through certification courses such as Kayaking One Star, Basic Wall Climbing and Abseiling.

They will then apply and hone these skills during our annual year end camp.
