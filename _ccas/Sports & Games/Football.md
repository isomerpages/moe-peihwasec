<h4><strong>Competitions and CCA Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Since 2017, the Pei Hwa Football Team have been participating in the yearly Northeast Friendship Tournament. The tournament was formed to provide another opportunity for students from schools in the Sengkang and Punggol areas to take part in a competition. Through this friendly competition, the students gained match experience, learned the importance of teamwork and developed friendships with their neighboring rivals.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Testament</strong></h4>
<p>&ldquo;My CCA really helped me open up and be less timid. My seniors really helped ease me into the CCA, guiding me along the way and improving myself as a person. I am very thankful to the teachers and my teammates who are constantly supportive of me. The CCA also allowed me to showcase my leadership skills and gave me opportunities to apply what I know. I really love Pei Hwa Football!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Vice-Captain of Football B Boys, Kirpal Singh, Int 1</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Football CCA helped me open up and make many more friends. In the past, I was quiet and unsure in my speech. Now, I am more confident and having a great time with others playing the sport we love. Not only does my CCA instil resilience and a sense of responsibility, it has also helped me develop leadership and public-speaking skills which could be helpful in the future! The teachers and seniors from upper secondary would always guide me when I am unsure. I am grateful for their guidance and patience!&rdquo;</p>
