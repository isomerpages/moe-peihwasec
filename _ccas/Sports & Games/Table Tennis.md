At Pei Hwa Secondary School, the Football CCA provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn and grow through this beloved sport.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:5px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description">One of the primary goals of the CCA is to promote teamwork and camaraderie among students. Students will learn the value of collaboration, communication, and how to handle setbacks and challenges as a team, which is a valuable life lesson that will serve them well in future. In addition to the social and emotional benefits, the CCA also provides many physical benefits for students. They will also learn important skills like coordination, balance, and body control, which are essential for success on the football field. Students will also develop other important values such as resilience, respect and self-discipline through weekly training sessions, friendlies and National School Games.</p>
