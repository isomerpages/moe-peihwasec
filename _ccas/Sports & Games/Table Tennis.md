<h4>Competitions and CCA Activities</h4>
<p>Apart from our participation in the annual National School Games, we also participate in friendly competitions with other schools. It gives us the opportunities to widen our network and expose ourselves to a broader range of challenge. It provides the players with opportunities to form meaningful bonds with competitors from other schools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really enjoy playing table tennis with my teammates during training sessions. We get the opportunity to acquire different techniques in preparation for competitions. I have learnt to work well with others, constantly improving my communication skills and teamwork. The CCA has also given me the opportunity to step up as a leader, which helped to nurture my leadership potential.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>CCA President (2019), Lim See Yune Shermayne (Right)</em></p><p>&ldquo;Pei Hwa&rsquo;s Table Tennis CCA is a place where one can be stretched to the fullest potential. Teachers, coach and CCA members are kind and friendly; they are my moral support, especially so in competitions. The CCA also provides me with numerous opportunities to develop soft skills such as leadership skills, communication skills and teamwork. Serving as a captain in 2019-2020 has also boosted my public speaking skills, which have benefitted me in many ways. Moreover, participating in various competitions has also allowed me to improve my table tennis skills, as well as sportsmanship. All in all, the CCA has allowed me to become a better person, especially under the guidance of my teachers, coach and peers.&rdquo;</p>
