<h4><strong>Student Testament</strong></h4>
<p>&ldquo;I have joined Taekwondo since 2018. Throughout my 4 year journey in Taekwondo, I have learnt many new skills and values and one of the values that I&rsquo;ve acquired is teamwork as it is heavily emphasized in the CCA. Although I did not know anything about Taekwondo, the coach and senior members patiently guided me to make sure I master the techniques well. During Poomsae competition, my members and I had to synchronize out steps and this required teamwork as well. As such, these experiences had proven to me that &ldquo;Teamwork makes the dream work&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>(</em>Lovelle Tey<em>, 4D8)</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;During the past 4 years in the Taekwondo CCA, I learnt many valuable lessons that now value and cherish. Values such as discipline, teamwork, communication and respect that i learnt during training sessions are now applicable in my daily life and future pathways&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>(Alysa Koh, 4D5)</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;This CCA has brought about the best in me. Training with the CCA teaches you core values that are essential in life like perseverance, resilience and respect. It has been an amazing experience with ups and downs. Don&rsquo;t be intimidated, give your 100% and it will be a fun few years that is unforgettable&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>(Javier Heng, 4D2)</em></strong></p>
