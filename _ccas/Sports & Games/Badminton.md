	"Through the badminton CCA, I've learnt and practiced values that will help me in the long run such as initiative, responsibility and discipline. Badminton has always been a passion of mine and after joining the cca, not only has my skills been cultivated but so has my character. This is all the result of the many wonderful members, teachers and coach. Since the first day I've joined, all the seniors have been very kind and helpful even during times where I couldn't keep up with the intense training, Not only did the seniors slow down to allow me to catch up but also checked up on me to see if I was doing okay. All these important events in my journey leads me to want to make this cca better in any way I can contribute. The cca has also given me many opportunities and helped build my confidence, I would not be where I was today if not for all the guidance I've received in this cca."

	"I enjoy badminton CCA as it nurtures my interest and passion towards the sport and forges strong bonds with my CCA members. In addition, this CCA has given me many opportunities to showcase my leadership skills and unleash my fullest potential regardless of it being through the values honed, like sportsmanship and teamwork, or the skills required gamewise. Although I suffered many setbacks during the CCA, my friends and teachers will always be there to encourage and support me to keep going and not throw in the towel. Every setback is a way to encourage myself to be a better person and build a positive attitude towards solving problems. All in all, the CCA has played a significant role in my Secondary school life which allows me to gain more experience to help me improve and learn from my mistakes."

	"I enjoy being in the badminton cca as I get to spend quality time with my juniors and cca members.  The countless cca sessions has brought us closer to one another and has allowed us to bond with one another through tiring training sessions as well as enjoyable bonding sessions. I am very thankful to my cca teachers in charge who have given me the opportunity to lead the cca and this has allowed me to better manage my priorities. During my first year in the cca, covid-19 hit extremely hard and had affected my training schedule. However, thanks to my amazing seniors, I was able to catch up after missing close to one year of cca. There were times where I felt lost and needed help in my skills, and the coach is willing to allow us to work on our mistakes and improve on our strengths at the same time. My cca has trained me to become a better leader through the times when I had to speak up to give instructions, allowing me to step up and out of my comfort zone and I am very thankful for that opportunity. Lastly, I am glad that I have friends who are helpful and they have helped me through my journey."

	"I enjoy my CCA a lot as I can make new friends from different levels and widen up my social circle. In our badminton CCA, we always learn new skills and techniques from one another and  we all can improve together. My CCA mates have been very supportive and caring towards me.  This CCA has not only taught me badminton skills but also taught me important values such as resilience, teamwork and sportsmanship. I always look forward to CCA as I get to mingle with my CCA mates and understand them better. This also gives us the opportunity to interact with different levels to know what everyone is learning about. We are united as one and we always share our problems and true feelings with one another. Despite the tough training, we enjoy ourselves as we all go through the hardship as a CCA."
