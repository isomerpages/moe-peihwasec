<p><strong>Competitions and CCA Activities</strong></p>
<p>Band exchange is a yearly programme during the preparation of SYF Arts Presentation. The purpose is to allow band students to deepen their appreciation, experience and exposure for music, and they build friendships through this exchange. It will enable students to enjoy the process of making music with others and coping with performance anxiety as they present their SYF and choice pieces in front of different schools. Schools will encourage one another and exchange gifts at the end of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Band has made my life in Secondary School more enjoyable through the different genres of music I got exposed to. Throughout my four years in Band, I have learnt many important skills such as teamwork and leadership. I cherish every performance as each brought the band more learning experiences and time to get to know each other more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being in Band will remain as one of my greatest memories in Secondary School. I got to make new friends, learn new skills, improve my leadership skills and train my discipline. Trying and learning new skills can seem daunting and difficult, but this is not the case in Band. In Band, our conductors, teachers, friends, and mentors teach us to improve our musical skills. Every band member collectively works together to improve the band in order to soar to greater heights and achieve greater feats, teaching me the importance of teamwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Band Major of Administration, Tristan Foo 4E1</em></p>
<img style="width: 30%;" src="/images/sband4.png" align = "right" /><p>&ldquo;To me Band was the place where I could express my emotions through music. Whenever a new piece was given to us, I always tried to interpret the meaning of the piece and the reasons why the piece was composed the way it was. As this continued on for the past years, it grew to become very enjoyable for me. Band has taught me that cooperation is key to any work that required a team of people. From Band I learnt that the results of any work or project are the results of the team&rsquo;s effort.&rdquo;</p>
