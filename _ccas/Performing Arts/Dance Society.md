<p>Pei Hwa Dance Society seeks to provide opportunities for students to explore their dance abilities and artistic expressions. We encourage students to explore various forms of dance through our two dance groups &ndash; Modern Dance and Chinese Dance. We endeavour to cultivate an appreciation for the arts in each of our students. In their journey as Pei Hwa dancers, students will learn the importance of teamwork through performing in an ensemble, resilience and perseverance through their dance practices, and discipline through our dance methodology.</p>
<h4><strong>Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Pei Hwa Dance Society has been a consistent participant at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. In our most recent entry, we successfully achieved Certificates of Distinction for the International and Chinese Dance categories.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Testimonials</strong></h4>
<p>In Pei Hwa Dance Society, we perform as an ensemble. Above all, we value the importance of camaraderie, harmony and unity. The bonds that are forged through hours of dance practices together, leave an indelible mark on every Pei Hwa dancer. Even upon graduation, our dancers remain tight-knit and supportive of one another.</p>
<p>We also lead a strong and robust mentorship programme. Our dance seniors and alumni are ever ready to dedicate their time and effort towards guiding and mentoring their dance juniors. In Pei Hwa Dance Society, everyone strives towards a common goal, and no student gets left behind.</p>
