<p>The Pei Hwa&nbsp;Choir&nbsp;was set up in 2007. Many of our members join the choir with little to no singing and music experience. Through the passion for singing and diligence, many of our singers have grown to become confident young ladies and men. With a repertoire from different cultures and genres, we continue to broaden our perspectives and stretch our potential in the choral scene. We are also able to have a rich variety of experiences through various public performances, choral exchanges and arts appreciation learning journeys. Even more so, what the members of Pei Hwa Choir are most thankful for, is the opportunity to come together to make music with our voices. &ldquo;We Sing as One!&rdquo;</p>

<h4><strong>Competitions and CCA Activities</strong></h4>
<p>We have always believed in honing the skills of the Choir through various Choral Exchanges with other schools. This provides valuable opportunities for the Choir to learn and share the love for music with one another.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Testament</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 33%;" src="/images/choir4.jpeg" align = "right" />
<p>&ldquo;Singing in a choir is definitely a different experience from just singing by yourself, especially when professionals teach you vocal skills &amp; technique and this really helps to improve your vocal skills. Great for people interested in singing! The best part is you do not need any previous musical background to join and all the seniors, instructors and teachers are there to guide you along when you are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>President of Choir, Rachel</em></p>

<p>I enjoy Choir as my CCA because I actually do like singing. At first I thought Choir is going to be very boring but it was completely the opposite. The people there makes it extra fun. It may be a little stressful when there are performances but these are opportunities for us to step out of our comfort zones and perform in and out of school. It was not always smooth but we learnt from our mistakes and did our best. It definitely makes the experience in Choir more memorable and enjoyable.&rdquo;<em> </em></p>
