<p>The Drama Society was set up in 2014. Many of our members join Drama with little to no acting or stage presentation experience. Through the passion for the drama craft, many of our budding actors have grown to become confident artists with no fear of performing in public or taking on performing roles that are in contrast to their individual characters. Through their involvement in the many process involved in staging a show, they have grown in maturity and acting skills. We are also able to have a rich variety of experiences through various public performances at SYF, Choral Reading for the lower sec at Literature Festival and attendance at live theatre performances.</p>

<h4><strong>Competitions and CCA Activities</strong></h4>
<p>We have always believed in honing the skills of our Drama members with interactions with other schools. This provides valuable opportunities for Drama members to learn and share the love for performance with one another.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Testament</strong></h4>
<img src="/images/drama4.jpeg">
<p>&ldquo;In Drama, I can be shameless, in a sense that I&rsquo;m comfortable being myself without the fear of being judged. I&rsquo;ve even been able to improve myself as a person during my time in this CCA, changing from someone who used to be insecure about almost every little thing I did to someone who feels confident to step out of my comfort zone even if I have to make myself look a little weird sometimes. I also feel as if my fellow CCA-mates are like another family to me, where we help each other learn and grow together no matter what our personalities are in this safe space. Here in Drama, I feel that we not only learn to act, but also learn to be the best version of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>President, Keira</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Drama is a place where you can truly be yourself. No, seriously. Take it from someone whose nickname is &ldquo;The Certified Weirdo&rdquo; when I say that whatever kind of weird, quirky personality you have we will welcome you wholeheartedly because sometimes, in this dull, boring world, a little weird is good. There are many important behind-the-scenes work that needs to be done too without you needing to show yourself like lights or sounds. So worry not if you don&rsquo;t enjoy acting on stage, because we&rsquo;ve got your back!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>Vice- President, Zorian</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Drama taught me lots of skills such as communication, awareness and made me more disciplined. It isn&rsquo;t just about acting.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>Vice-President (Logistics), Lau Ern</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I love about drama is that I enjoy the member&rsquo;s company and trainer&rsquo;s guidance. Drama will no doubt make you look forward to it.&rdquo;</p>
