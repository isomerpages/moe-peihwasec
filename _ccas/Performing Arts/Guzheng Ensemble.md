<h4><strong>Student Testament&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most memorable experience was when we went for our first rehearsal a day before the recital. The happy smiles and proud looks on everyone&rsquo;s faces were really priceless. When it was time for a full run, everyone was proud to play the songs together at the actual performance place. The whole experience was a good opportunity for us to perform and show people the music that guzheng can produce. It was really fun to work together with, to encourage and to help each other in the process of preparing for the recital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My journey here in Pei Hwa Guzheng Ensemble has been remarkable. I have received undivided love and support from my teachers and peers these. Throughout the 4 years, I was able to forge new friendships with both my seniors and juniors, and these friendships have shaped me to be who I am today. Being in Guzheng Ensemble has allowed me to develop at my own pace, and I am immeasurably grateful for that. The many opportunities to perform at various stages have taught me determination, resilience and teamwork. These experiences will undoubtedly stay with me throughout my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&ndash; Mandy Low, on her experience in Guzheng Ensemble</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I reminisce about my secondary school life, my time in Guzheng Ensemble will be the first thing that comes to mind. During my time in the ensemble, I have grown tremendously both as a leader and performer under the guidance of the teachers and instructors, as well as the support of my peers.</p>
<p>As a performer, I have improved in my musicianship and learnt to be resilient in the face of adversity. As a leader, I have learnt to be understanding towards others and how to work with others to achieve a common goal.</p>
<p>The journey of preparing for SYF or any performances is never easy. We worked hard on refining the pieces and working on the small details for weeks and months until the actual day of the performance, so that we can proudly showcase our craft. My experiences in Guzheng Ensemble is something that and I will always be thankful for and I will not trade them for anything.&rdquo;</p>
