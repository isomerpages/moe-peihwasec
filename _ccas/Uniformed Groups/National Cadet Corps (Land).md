<p><strong>Tagline</strong></p>
<p>Nurturing. Committed. Cool.</p>
<p>In Pei Hwa NCC, we have in place the motto &ldquo;Learning Above All&rdquo;. Together with a team of dedicated teachers, mentors and seniors, we create an environment for cadets where they do not fear failure, but instead, fear the lack of trying. Together with the &ldquo;Cadet Strong&rdquo; framework, the 3-tiered curriculum, as well as through teachable moments, we aim to develop cadets to have outstanding moral and character values. Our training often incorporates outdoor components which are fun and engaging. Through our trainings, cadets also build bonds and a sense of brotherhood.</p>

<p><strong>Student Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>NCC seeks to build our cadets on the &ldquo;Cadet Strong&rdquo; framework. We do this by building and strengthening these three key aspects of the cadet: the MIND, the BODY and the HEART.</p>

<p><strong>Competitions and CCA Activities</strong></p>
<p>Part of the Cadet Strong framework, cadets are required to build their mental resilience. Our HQ milestone camps such as&nbsp;<strong>Camp Forge</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Camp Steel</strong>&nbsp;help do this and are therefore one of the key highlights of every cadets&rsquo; journey in NCC.</p>

<p>Cadets take part in physically demanding activities such as&nbsp;<strong>fitness challenge</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>cluster sports competitions</strong>. These activities build their physical fitness. They also get to bond with cadets from other schools.</p>

<p><strong>The Precision Drill Squad and Freestyle D</strong><strong>rill Competitions</strong>&nbsp;not only tests the cadet&rsquo;s mental strength, but also their hand-to-eye coordination and physical endurance. Beyond that, there is a certain self-discipline required for the cadet to be able to undergo the rigorous training as well. Teamwork and trust also comes into play if the routine is to go smoothly and in perfect sync.</p>
