<p><strong>National Civil Defence Cadet Corps &ndash; a choice uniformed group of community first responders</strong></p>
<p>NCDCC cadets always strive to&nbsp;<strong>Learn</strong>&nbsp;the Triangle of Life skills, which include basic firefighting, first aid and CPR+AED so as to be able to&nbsp;<strong>Lead&nbsp;</strong>their peers upon going through one of the three tracks under the Specialisation Model. They will then in turn&nbsp;<strong>Serve</strong>&nbsp;their school or the wider community through public education platforms such as being advocates of Emergency Preparedness. The learning cycle will continue to evolve to a higher plane of achievement such as lending a helping hand as Community First Responders. The Learn Lead Serve Motto serves as the guiding principle for all trainings and activities in NCDCC.</p>
<h4><strong>Student Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>NCDCC seeks to develop and empower our youths to be active and concerned citizens advocating life-saving skills.</p>
