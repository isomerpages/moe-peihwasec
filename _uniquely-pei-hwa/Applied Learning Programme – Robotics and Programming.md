<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0; font-family:sans-serif">Pei Hwa Secondary’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Robotics and Programming aims to empower students with the technological and thinking skills that will enable them to be innovative and empathetic members of the community.&nbsp;Recognised by MOE Educational Technology Division (ETD) as the Zonal Lead School for Making from 2019 to 2022, we are
dedicated to enriching our students' educational experience with maker education and extending maker activities to students in the North Zone. Moreover, we actively foster partnerships with technology companies to expand our industrial connections, offering our
students opportunities for work attachments, learning journeys and invaluable real-world experiences beyond the classroom.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0; font-family:sans-serif">With the goal of nurturing our students' innovativeness to equip them for the dynamic and ever-changing world, Pei Hwa has embraced a tiered approach to their development. This approach takes into account their individual interests and readiness levels, providing opportunities for them to explore, apply, and showcase their innovative mindset in the fields of Robotics and Programming. In addition, as part of the Lower Secondary Future Leaders Programme, our ALP has been enhanced and synergised through a collaborative effort with LLP and the various
academic subjects to equip our students with future ready skills to succeed in the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) world.</p>

<p style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:0;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Streamnovation&nbsp;Week</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif">Streamnovation Week is a week-long programme which aims to provide opportunities for students to immerse in STEM and innovation, with the infusion of Reading and the Arts. Students get to participate in a level-wide making challenge with their classmates, and they can also sign up for learning journeys, speaker series and making activities.</p>

<p style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:0;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Maker Monday</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0;font-family:sans-serif;">Maker Monday is an interest group which allows students to experience making and tinkering. Having a maker culture&nbsp;not only gives our students an edge in their future endeavours, but also
enables our students to experience the joy of learning, and build their confidence and creativity.</p>

<p style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:0;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">STEM Playground Challenge</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">STEM Playground Challenge is a national platform organised by CPDD Science, Science Centre and the James Dyson Foundation to encourage interest, curiosity and creativity in STEM
activities and develop school spirit alongside 21CC skills in our students. In STEM Playground Challenges, students will work in groups and exercise their creativity to innovate and design structures according to the stated theme.</p>

<p style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:0;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Pei Hwa Hackathon</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">As we get our students ready for their future endeavours, we believe that it is important for our students to share their skills and knowledge with the community too. Pei Hwa Hackathon is a competition held for primary school students with the aim of enhancing their coding and problem-solving skills. This is an opportunity for our students to be trained as assistant maker coaches. These students will undergo comprehensive training to assume the role of facilitators and troubleshooters during the Hackathon. It is also a platform for them to hone their leadership skills as they lead and guide the different groups of primary school students.</p>
