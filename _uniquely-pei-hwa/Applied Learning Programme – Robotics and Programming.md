<h4 style="color:black;font-weight:bold;font-family:sans-serif;">Our Goals</h4>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">Pei Hwa Secondary’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Robotics and Programming aims to empower students with the technological and thinking skills that will enable them to be innovative and empathetic members of the community.&nbsp;Recognised by MOE Educational Technology Division (ETD) as the Zonal Lead School for Making from 2019 to 2022, we are
dedicated to enriching our students' educational experience with maker education and extending maker activities to students in the North Zone. Moreover, we actively foster partnerships with technology companies to expand our industrial connections, offering our
students opportunities for work attachments, learning journeys and invaluable real-world experiences beyond the classroom.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">With the goal of nurturing our students' innovativeness to equip them for the dynamic and ever-changing world, Pei Hwa has embraced a tiered approach to their development. This approach takes into account their individual interests and readiness levels, providing opportunities for them to explore, apply, and showcase their innovative mindset in the fields of Robotics and Programming. In addition, as part of the Lower Secondary Future Leaders Programme, our ALP has been enhanced and synergised through a collaborative effort with LLP and the various
academic subjects to equip our students with future ready skills to succeed in the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) world.</p>
