<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Each student talent is profiled via various tools so that he or she understands his or her areas of strengths, preferred working style and career interests.

opportunities for in-depth discussions that nurture critical and creative thinking as well as problem-solving skills.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif">The teacher mentor spends quality time in providing effective, timely and personalised

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Student talents from PHTA are challenged to examine and form new insights and knowledge through the interdisciplinary application of concepts in some of these programmes. The programme incorporates independent learning and problem-based learning to prepare student talents for the intellectual rigour beyond secondary school. Student talents will be
given the opportunity to carry out inter-disciplinary exploration under the guidance of experienced mentors. This allows them to go beyond the textbook and embark on a journey of self-discovery.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif">Pei Hwa Talent Academy aims to provide opportunities and platforms for our student talents to
excel in the various academic disciplines via the Excite, Experience and Excel approach (Fig. 1).</p>

<p style="line-height:2;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:0;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">1. EXCITE</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">‘Excite’ aims to provide PHTA scholars with opportunities to be exposed to learning beyond their curriculum, and to excite and inspire them to excel and work towards a purposeful goal in the programme. Some of the activities will include conferences, seminars, workshops and learning journeys to external organisations or institutions.</p>

<p style="line-height:2;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:0;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">2. EXPERIENCE</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Students in the PHTA will experience a series of customised and developmental
programmes (e.g. research, competitions, workshops and learning) that go beyond the normal curriculum.&nbsp;They are also enrolled in various vendor-led and/or teacher-led
workshops such as communication, collaboration and presentation to equip them with various skill sets to prepare them for the future of work. These workshops are customised according to the readiness levels of the student talents. In addition to these developmental
programmes, students will be given various opportunities to exhibit their learning during external competitions and showcase. The platform for competitions and showcase will not only help build their portfolio but also help them benchmark with the best at national and international levels.</p>

<p style="line-height:2;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:0;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">3. EXCEL</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">PHTA scholars will be provided with opportunities to experience authentic learning beyond the classroom. These include industrial work attachments and classroom learning
experiences in Junior College. Such platforms seek to expose students to real work environments where they can discover their passion, learn about specific industries and how the workplace deals with challenges whilst developing their interpersonal and communication skills. This will be instrumental to equip PHTA scholars with the knowledge to make well-informed choices for their post-secondary education pathway, i.e. Direct School Admission to Junior Colleges. Prior to graduation, each PHTA Scholar will receive a certificate and alsoand create an e-portfolio detailing the list of activities and contributions that he/she has participated in. In addition, students’ achievements will be updated in the LEAPS accordingly.</p>
