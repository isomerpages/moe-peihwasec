<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Pei Hwa Secondary School’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Community Youth Leadership (CYL) contributes to the holistic development of the students. The LLP is designed to bring students through a four- to five-year programme to develop forward-looking leaders who will play an active part in contributing to the community. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Under the LLP, a four- to five-year Values - in - Action (VIA) programme is designed to develop students who have a heart to lead and serve others and play an active part in contributing to the community. The VIA programme aims to inculcate values, develop empathy and care for others in our students and equip them with leadership and problem-solving skills. The VIA programme provides students with platforms to lead and serve others to make a positive difference to the community. </p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">The VIA programme takes on a tiered approach to engage students at varying levels of interests. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Tier 1 VIA programme involves all students, and it takes on a progressive approach to nurture and develop students to have the heart to lead and serve others.</p>

<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;">The school has integrated its ALP in Robotics and Programming and LLP in Community Youth Leadership and repositioned it as the Future Leaders Programme, which is a signature programme for the Lower Secondary students that focuses on students innovating solutions to tomorrow’s problems using the Pei Hwa Secondary School Innovation Cycle and programming skills. Secondary 1 students work on projects with a focus on addressing the issues of their more immediate context of school, while the Secondary 2 students extend the scale of their impact to a wider community outside of school and the environment. </li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;">The Secondary 3 students work on student-initiated projects where they work together as a class and take ownership of the processes of identifying community issues, initiating plans, and taking actions to make a positive difference to the community. </li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;">The Secondary 4 and 5 students participate in an annual Charity Food Drive. In this food donation drive, our students help to collect and sort donated food items which will be donated to Food from the Heart, to help the less privileged families. In addition, as part of the commemoration of International Friendship Day, our Secondary 4 and 5 students engage in research on ASEAN countries. As a class, they set up booths to present their findings to Secondary 1 to 3 students, to deepen their understanding of the cultures of the ASEAN countries. </li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-top:0px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Our Tier 2 VIA programme offers an opportunity for students who have a strong passion to make a difference in the community beyond regular VIA activities. They can sign up to join our VIA interest group, where they can further contribute and fulfill their desire to serve.Within this tier, students have the opportunity to serve the community in various ways. The programmes range from being a part of existing programmes such as kidsRead which is organised by the National Library Board, to initiating their own VIA projects. Teacher mentors guide this group of students to help them see their VIA projects to fruition, to make a positive difference to the school or the community. </p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">
We are committed to equipping all our students with knowledge and skills to be effective leaders in the different areas of their lives. We adopt the 5 practices of The Leadership Challenge as our training model for student leadership development. The leadership development in Pei Hwa Secondary School takes on a tiered approach. At each tier, the training programme and leadership development opportunities are specially catered to the groups.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Tier 1 student leaders refer to all students. At Tier 1, students do not need to hold a leadership position or title. Level-wide training programmes are conducted for Tier 1 student leaders to equip them with leadership knowledge and skills which they can apply in daily living, in and outside of school, during curricular and non-curricular contexts. </p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">The focus of the training is progressive and incremental over the students’ 4 to 5 years in Pei Hwa Secondary School.</p>

<ol style="margin-top:-5px;list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;">At Secondary 1, the focus is on self-leadership, where student leaders learn to identify and prioritise important personal values. They strive to become role models by aligning their actions with these shared values. </li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;">At Secondary 2, student leaders learn to work better with others by learning to foster collaboration through building trust, developing relationships and strengthening others. They learn to leverage their own strengths and competencies, as well as those of others, within a team. They also learn how to apply conflict management techniques to work harmoniously with others. </li>
<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;">At Secondary 3, the focus of the training is on leading others. 
Student leaders are encouraged to envision meaningful possibilities for the future and to learn how to engage and inspire others to collaborate towards common goals. In the process of working towards their goals, student leaders are encouraged to challenge the status quo and to explore innovative ways to improve current practices and approaches.</li>
	<li style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;margin-left:17px;font-family:sans-serif;">At Secondary 4 and 5, student leaders focus on leaving a legacy in their graduating year. They learn to reflect on their past journey and to anchor themselves as they embark on their future endeavours. They would learn to express their passion and inspire others for the future. Student leaders also learn to foster a sense of community by celebrating shared values and victories.</li>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Tier 2 student leaders include Class Leaders, Peer Support Leaders and CCA Executive Committee members while Tier 3 student leaders include Student Councillors and CCA Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons.
