<h4><strong>2022 Cohort Sec 1 Uniform and Textbook Purchases</strong></h4>
<p>Parents are to make a booking via PickTime (refer to Annex D above for instructions) to enter Pei Hwa Secondary School (Please note that only ONE parent can accompany the child into the school premises as per SMM guidelines). You can use this time to purchase textbooks, uniforms or both.&nbsp;</p>
<img style="width: 23%;" src="/images/unnamed-2-175x300.jpg" />
<p>* Do note that in the event of uniform sizes unavailability, do be assured that the school has made flexible arrangements should there be a need for your child to wear their Primary school attire for the first week of school at least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*In adherence to SMM, parents will not be allowed to drive into the school. You are able to park at the following public car parks that are conveniently located near the school:</p>

<p>Are there locker facilities for students?</p>
<p>Ans: Yes. Lockers are available on a yearly basis at $26. Students are strongly encouraged to rent&nbsp;a locker as they will be frequently moving between classrooms and it will help them in carrying&nbsp;lesser materials during lessons. Interested applicants may register, apply and pay online through&nbsp;the vendor&rsquo;s (KAICHI SPACEMASTER PTE LTD) website at www.rent-a-locker.com</p>
