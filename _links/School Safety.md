<h4>Food Safety in School</h4>
<p>Food can be easily contaminated and become unsafe for eating. Food contaimination may occur when cooked food is accidentally mixed with raw meat&nbsp;juices, or when food is exposed to dirt, chemicals, bacteria, viruses or other pathogens. This usually happens because we do not handle our food safely or observe proper hygiene.</p>
<p>Eating contaminated food can cause food poisoning, which can range from mild to severe cases of food poisoning, which could be fatal.&nbsp; We can help safeguard our personal health by maintaining personal hygiene and practising good habits.</p>
