<h4><strong>Logo</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 30%;" src="/images/logo.png" />
<p>The logo is formed by the Chinese characters &ldquo;Pei&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hwa&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Nurturing Talents&rdquo;. Central to the logo is the figure representing a resilient Pei Hwa pupil who is happy and confident even as he leaps over each obstacle. He is upright (as shown by the &ldquo;li&rdquo; character at the top of the figure&rsquo;s head) and grounded (as shown by the &ldquo;tu&rdquo; character) in values. His education in Pei Hwa has enabled him to embrace the world of knowledge with open arms and to push beyond current boundaries.</p><hr>

<h4><strong>Motto</strong></h4>
<p>Nurturing Talents (meaning of the word &lsquo;Pei Hwa&rsquo; in Chinese)</p><hr>
