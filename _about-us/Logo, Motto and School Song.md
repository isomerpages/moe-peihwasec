<h4><strong>Logo</strong></h4>
<img style="width:30%; margin-top: 12px; align:left;" src="/images/logo.png" />
<p style="font-size:15px;line-height:2;">The logo is formed by the Chinese characters &ldquo;Pei&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hwa&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Nurturing Talents&rdquo;. Central to the logo is the figure representing a resilient Pei Hwa pupil who is happy and confident even as he leaps over each obstacle. He is upright (as shown by the &ldquo;li&rdquo; character at the top of the figure&rsquo;s head) and grounded (as shown by the &ldquo;tu&rdquo; character) in values. His education in Pei Hwa has enabled him to embrace the world of knowledge with open arms and to push beyond current boundaries.</p>

<h4><strong>Motto</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Nurturing Talents (meaning of the word &lsquo;Pei Hwa&rsquo; in Chinese)</p>

<h4><strong>School Song</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">In Pei Hwa Secondary School<br>We are the pride of the community<br>To lead and serve with integrity<br>We grow in our resiliency</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Though there be many challenges<br>Our passion remains strong<br>We learn and work diligently<br>To be the best that we can be</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;">Here in Pei Hwa<br>Our talents are nurtured<br>Here in Pei Hwa<br>Where we share in harmony<br>We&rsquo;ll spread our wings<br>Fly far and high<br>To bring pride and glory<br>To the happy Pei Hwa family</p>
