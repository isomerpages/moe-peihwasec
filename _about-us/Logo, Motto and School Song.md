<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-weight:bold;">Logo</h4>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; ">
The logo is formed by the Chinese characters &ldquo;Pei&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hwa&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Nurturing Talents&rdquo;. Central to the logo is the figure representing a resilient Pei Hwa pupil who is happy and confident even as he leaps over each obstacle. He is upright (as shown by the &ldquo;li&rdquo; character at the top of the figure&rsquo;s head) and grounded (as shown by the &ldquo;tu&rdquo; character) in values. His education in Pei Hwa has enabled him to embrace the world of knowledge with open arms and to push beyond current boundaries.</p>
