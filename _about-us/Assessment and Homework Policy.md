<h4><strong><u>SCHOOL BASED ASSESSMENT 2022</u></strong></h4>

<p style="font-size:15px;">In meeting the challenges of an increasingly complex world, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced changes to School Based Assessment in 2019 to help our students discover more joy in learning and to develop them as lifelong learners. In alignment with MOE’s efforts to move away from an over-emphasis on academic results, the school continues to review our internal assessments to create time and space for teachers and students to strengthen engagement in learning, self-discovery and holistic development.</p>

<p><strong>Modes of Assessment</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;">All modes of assessments are important as they provide feedback to the students, teachers and parents about what the students have learnt and how well they have applied their learning.</p>

<p><strong>Formative Assessment</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;">Formative Assessment is carried out during lessons to provide feedback to adjust on-going teaching and learning in order to improve students’ learning in the classroom. They are often given in the form of class assignments, mini quizzes and presentations aimed to help students identify their strengths and weaknesses and target areas that need support. Timed practice will continue to be given to students to prepare them for formal assessments and to ensure that they are ready for the end-of-year examinations. Teachers use these practice exercises as formative assessments to give students feedback on areas for improvement. Formative assessment scores, if any, are&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;weighted.</p>

<p><strong>Weighted Assessment (WA)</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;">Weighted Assessments (WA) are carried out once a term and the scores attained are weighted and count towards the subject grade. It gives students, teachers and parents information on students’ mastery of content, knowledge and skills.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;">Termly WAs are often carried out in the form of a class test, a project, or standardised assignments. Standardised examinations conducted at the end of Term 2 (Sec 4/ 5) and Term 4 (all levels) are also considered WAs that evaluate our students’ academic progress and achievement.</p>

<p><strong>Weighting of Assessments</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;">The following table details the weighting for the assessments in each term. With the new directions from MOE, there will be not more than one weighted assessment per subject per term.</p>

<p><strong>Removal of Mid-Year Examination (MYE) for Sec 1, 2 and 3</strong></p>
<p>With the removal of Mid-Year Examinations for Sec 1, 2 and 3, the school will continue with the current practice of gathering information about students’ learning through checkpoints such as class assignments, mini quizzes, presentations&nbsp;and weighted assessments. Whilst only the weighted assessment counts towards the overall result, all other forms of assessment and learning are still crucial in helping our students develop the necessary knowledge and skills for the various subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Regulations&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Applicable to all weighted assessments including examinations)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In the event of absence from any assessment due to urgent family or medical reasons, official documentation such as medical certificates from recognised medical practitioners (i.e government medical officers or those registered under the Medical Registration Act) must be presented upon return. Medical certificates issued by doctors who are currently not registered under the Medical Registration Act will not be accepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who are absent will be given the assessment as practice but the mark obtained will not be included in the overall mark computation.</p>
<p>A medical certificate or a copy of the death certificate has to be given to the form teacher when the student returns to school. All other reasons are to be considered on a case-by-case basis subject to the school’s approval.</p>
<p>For students who are absent for a weighted assessment with no valid reason, they will be given a zero mark for that assessment and this assessment mark will be included in the computation of the subject and overall total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For other detailed examination regulations, please refer to page 20 of the student handbook.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HOMEWORK POLICY 2022</strong></span></h4>
<p>Homework is work that is set to be done outside the time-tabled curriculum. Pei Hwa Secondary School believes that&nbsp;reasonable amounts of academic effort outside the class can enhance student learning,&nbsp;improve achievement&nbsp;and&nbsp;develop students’ study skills. Homework provides an opportunity for students to revisit the concepts or skills taught during lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homework refers to any task which students are required to carry out for a subject outside of time-tabled curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery. This includes projects or research work, but not revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.</p>

<li>Homework assignments will not be given over festive periods during term time, e.g. Chinese New Year, Deepavali and Hari Raya Puasa.</li>
<li>Teachers are mindful that students will not be overloaded with homework and practice papers in the week before Semester Assessments. Students are to use the time to revise for their subjects.</li>
