<p>MOE has identified competencies that have become increasingly important in the 21st Century. These competencies, represented in the following framework, underpin the holistic education that our schools provide to better prepare our students for the future. With the use of technology, the students adopt various methodologies and approaches in their learning. For example, students carry out inquisitive learning skills and problem-solving skills through the use of educational technology.</p>
