<h3><strong>Our Goals</strong></h3>
<p>We hope to cultivate our student&rsquo; interest for Mother Tongue Languages so as to enable them to learn and apply the language in their daily lives. Beyond learning the language, we also strive to empower our students with the understanding of Singapore and the world through the culture embedded in our Mother Tongue Languages.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that the learning of languages should not be confined by the boundaries of a classroom. The best learning should come from exposure and application. Therefore, the department adopts a tiered approach to enhance our students&rsquo; learning of Mother Tongue Languages.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Student Learning</strong></h3>
<p>The department believes in infusing fun in the learning of languages and has thus gone beyond the conventional pen and paper when it comes to learning of languages.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px;"><strong>Building Reading Skills</strong></p>
<p>The CL department curates reads for our students and encourages students to read through reading competitions. During this year&rsquo;s Circuit Breaker, a reading competition was conducted with the use of SLS. Students get to choose the curated read they like and then express their reflections in the mode they are most comfortable with, be it through a drawing, a vodcast or even through a song.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px;"><strong>Game Based Learning</strong></p>
<p>The ML department makes it point for learning to be fun. The teachers created a game for students to grasp the concept of <em>pantun</em> and have conducted the game both physically and virtually. This interesting way of learning was also selected to be shared in Teacher Led Workshops with other schools.</p>
