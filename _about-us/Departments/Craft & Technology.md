<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-weight:bold">The Art Unit</h4>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">At Pei Hwa, we aim to develop a love for Art in our pupils so that they would be creative and confident learners. Our lessons are designed to allow students to&nbsp;appreciate art from various contexts. This is achieved through exploring the&nbsp;different craft types in both 2D and 3D art forms. Pupils in the lower secondary are&nbsp;introduced to observational drawing, photography and ceramics while upper secondary pupils are equipped with painting, printmaking and critique skills. The&nbsp;exposure to different media allows pupils to have a sense of achievement in the&nbsp;practice of Art.</p>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/ct4.jpg" />

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">The Design &amp; Technology Unit aims to instill in our pupils the design-thinking culture. This is achieved mainly through product design which is essentially meeting user&rsquo;s needs through technology where applicable. The resilience, confidence and problem-solving skills acquired by the pupils prepare them for the challenges which they may face after they graduate from secondary school. Pupils in the Lower Secondary are introduced various aspects of technology (namely structures, electronics and mechanisms) and how they are used to meet our everyday needs. They are also taught basic skills in the handling of tools and simple machinery which is essential in the realization of a design project.</p>

<p  style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px;">Pupils in the upper secondary level cover technology topics in greater depth and focus on the application of technology in their design coursework. In the area of design, pupils are required to complete one cycle of design, from identification of user&rsquo;s needs to ideation and finally the realisation (making) of the design.</p>
