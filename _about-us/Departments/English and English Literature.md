<h4><strong>Our Goals</strong></h4>
<p>Through English and Literature, we endeavour to inculcate in students a love for the English language, and an appreciation of the intricacies of the language in creating meaning, in order to develop them into confident communicators.</p>
<p>We aim to give students the opportunity to formulate their ideas and share their thoughts during discussions and presentations in class.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Slice of Life</strong></p>
<p>Our students take to the stage on Friday mornings to share their thoughts and viewpoints on our student outcomes, school values and current affairs. These &lsquo;slices&rsquo; of their lives are savoured by the Pei Hwa Family.</p>

<p><strong>PHeature</strong></p>
<p>PHeature is a broadcast programme in PHSS where student leaders take turns to share interesting news with the school to encourage the reading of current affairs.</p>
