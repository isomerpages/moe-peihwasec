<h4><strong>Our Goals</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Management Department looks into the holistic development of the students. It assists the teachers in classroom management and is responsible for the development of students&rsquo; life skills and the ability to learn collaboratively. It is upheld by our 5 core school values of Passion for Learning, Resilience, Integrity, Diligence and Excellence for Self and Others (PRIDE). These values are also translated into the school rules and regulations. The Department works hand-in-hand with parents, the community and other external agencies in helping the students realise the school&rsquo;s vision.</p>

<p><strong>Affirmation Post Cards</strong></p>
<p>The affirmation post cards aim to recongise students who demonstrate the school&rsquo;s PRIDE values by getting the school staff to write a message and &lsquo;surprise&rsquo; parents and students by mailing it to their home.</p>
<p><strong>Punctuality Education Programme (PEP)</strong></p>
<p>This proactive and preventive measure is used to instill in students the habit of being punctual for school and all other activities. After all, punctuality is a life skill that everyone should possess. The programme hopes to work with all parents to inculcate this habit in all our students.</p><hr>
