<h4><strong>Our Goals</strong></h4>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px;">To develop each student to be an Altruist:</p>

<ul>

<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">The CCE curriculum provides invaluable lessons and learning experiences to help our students internalise and practise good values and skills, and develop competencies that are critical to character and citizenship development.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px;">Through CCE, school leaders and staff will facilitate students’ thinking to help them make responsible decisions based on sound values, and guide them in becoming caring individuals and useful citizens.</p>

<p><strong>Components in CCE</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">As part of MOE’s focus on a Student-Centric, Values-Driven Education, the Character and Citizenship Education (CE), and Social-Emotional Learning (SEL); and will emphasise the interconnectedness of values, knowledge, skills and competencies taught in these areas:</p>

<p><strong>Weekly CCE Lessons</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">In the weekly lessons, teachers use students’&nbsp;life experiences to form possible contexts for the delivery of CCE, so that students can better retain the knowledge, skills and values taught. The three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices are the core concepts in CCE to enable deeper understanding in the process of character development.</p>

<p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">ECG focuses on nurturing students’ self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning and enabling students to explore viable education and career options through equipping them with accurate and comprehensive information. ECG helps students to develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities as well as an appreciation for different career pathways.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">ECG is delivered through classroom learning and community experiences such as career talks, career guidance and counselling.</p><br>

<p><strong>Sexuality Education (SEd)</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">Details are available&nbsp;<a href="/programmes/sexuality-education/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">Cyber wellness focuses on developing the students’ instinct to protect them and empower them to take responsibility for their well-being in cyberspace. They&nbsp;have the opportunities to explore cyber wellness issues. Regular assembly talks and classroom sessions, workshops for students and parents, as well as counselling for more at-risk students, are provided to promote cyber wellness among pupils. Click <a href="/links/links-for-parents/"> here</a>&nbsp;for more links and information&nbsp;on cyber wellness.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters students’ ownership over how they can contribute to the community. Students have the opportunity to reflect on their experiences, the values they put into practice and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully. VIA is an important component of our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).</p>

<p><strong>Citizenship Education (CE) (National Education)</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;">National Education (NE) is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop in our students an understanding and appreciation of Singapore and citizenship in this world of complexity. We hope to inspire our students to take collective ownership of our future as a nation and to co-construct the next chapter of Singapore.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin:0 0 13px 0px;">NE will be anchored on the citizenship dispositions: A Sense of Belonging, A Sense of Reality, A Sense of Hope and The Will to Act. In order to achieve these dispositions, we encourage students to discuss Singapore’s contemporary realities through issues and to engage in learning experiences to immerse themselves in the culture and art of Singapore, and also in other areas such as our geography and history and the economic and geo-social-political context.</p>
