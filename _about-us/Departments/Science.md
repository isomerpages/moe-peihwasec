<h4><strong>Our Goals</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">We endeavor to develop students into inquisitive and keen learners of the Sciences and the natural world and to enable them to view the pursuit of science as meaningful and useful. In alignment to the Science Curriculum Framework, we aim to prepare our students to be sufficiently adept as effective citizens, able to function in, make informed decisions and to contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven world.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">In the Science department, teaching strategy such as collaborative learning is deployed to nurture students into self-directed learners. Science lessons are inquiry in nature and the teachers of Sciences facilitate and role model the inquiry process in the classrooms. In the teaching and learning of the Sciences, understanding of scientific content, knowledge and skills is reinforced and enhanced through experiential learning such as practical sessions as well as beyond the classroom experiences though enrichment programs.</p>



<h4><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">The Science Department seeks to provide meaningful learning experiences for students through various enrichment programs and competitions to provide students with the opportunity to learn science outside of the classrooms. Through partnership with external organisations, students are exposed to science and technologies it entails beyond the textbooks. By participating in competitions, we can nurture a greater passion for science in our students.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment Programmes</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Chemical Powered Car</em></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">Students designed and created chemically powered cars out of everyday normal plastic bottles and the cars were propelled forward by a non-toxic chemical reaction. Examples of such reactions include baking soda mixed with vinegar.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fun With Electronics Workshop at Science Center</em></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">Students attended a workshop in Science Center. They were introduced to several basic electronic components (resistors, LEDs, capacitors, transistors) and were given the opportunity to build electronic circuits utilising their properties on a breadboard (prototyping board).</p>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/Enrichment - Electronic Workshop.png" />

<p><strong><em>Cosmetic Science Workshop</em></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">During a Cosmetic Science workshop, students learnt about emulsification and how creams are made as emulsions. They made their own cold cream and sunscreen using natural products.</p>

<p><strong>Competitions</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>NUS Crystal Growing Competition</em></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">The NUS Crystal Growing Competition is held bi-annually, organised by the Chemistry Department. Students from secondary schools, international schools, junior colleges, ITE colleges and polytechnics in Singapore were invited to take part in the competition. Through the mastery of the art of crystal growing, our students had the opportunity to exercise their creativity, individuality and discover the elegant science during the process.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">Using their scientific knowledge and conducting their research, our students had to determine the mass of starting chemicals to use and derive a suitable method to make the required salt crystals. Our students managed to grow seed crystals that are of appropriate size and shape after multiple attempts over a few weeks.</p>

<img style="width: 70%;" src="/images/seed.png" />

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">The choice of chemicals and method of crystallisation were left to the students to decide. Our students went on to do their research and discussion with the teacher mentor on the possible chemicals and methods to prepare the crystals for this category. Finally, they decided on growing potassium aluminium sulfate (alum). The students encountered many issues such as unable to grow the seed crystals and failure to stain the alum red permanently during the process. With their perseverance and determination, they overcome the challenges and managed to grow their first seed crystals after some weeks. Even though the students did not manage to continue with the crystallization due to Covid-19, our students had learnt a lot during the process. They realized that not every experiment will be successful and in fact, it takes a long time to research, experimenting and continuous trying so as to achieve some positive results.</p>

<p><strong><em>18<sup>th</sup> Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition</em></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">A group of students, who were concerned about the unpredictable haze situation in Singapore and the high cost of air filters, investigated how low-cost air filters could be developed to improve the quality of lives of Singaporeans. After conducting research, they developed two low-cost air filters and tested the efficiency of these air filters. These air filters were placed in metal tins and a mosquito coil was lit to mimic a very hazy atmosphere. The concentrations of particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5), Formaldehyde and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) were measured every 5 minutes over a 30-minute period, using an indoor air quality detector. The students concluded that the air filter with activated carbon attached to a fan was effective in reducing harmful substances in the surrounding air. The objective of making a significantly cheaper air filter was also achieved. The students presented their findings to the judges and were awarded the Gold Award. Throughout the entire journey, the students nurtured their interest in investigative-type projects in science and developed their communication skills.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Student Learning</strong></h4>
<p><strong>HBL LSS Virtual Practical</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px;"><strong>Topic: Photosynthesis &amp; Respiration</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">As students are not able to carry out the experiment in the laboratory due to social distancing measures, virtual practical lessons were designed to allow students to have the concrete experience in order to conceptualize learning. One of such lesson is carried out in our Secondary One level where students are to investigate if chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-left:20px; font-size:15px;line-height:2;">Student were provided with a picture of a variegated leaf to practice on biological drawing. They were taught to calculate magnification using the formula of widest length of drawing / widest length of specimen.</li>
	
<img style="width: 40%;" src="/images/leaf.jpg" />
	
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;line-height:1.6;margin-top:10px;"><em>variegated leaf sample</em></p>
	
<li style="margin-left:20px; font-size:15px;line-height:2"> As students do not get to carry out the experiment. They are provided with a video and an animation to show the steps to test for starch in leaf. The video also included the explanation to why each step is being carried out.</li>
	</ol>
<p style="font-size:15px;">The links to the video/animation are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:20px; font-size:15px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeU7ULL9Usw&amp;t=6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeU7ULL9Usw&amp;t=6s</a></li>

</ul>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/Sec 1 Bio virtual practical lesson pic.jpg" />

<ol start=3>
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px; line-height:2;"> After understanding the experiment, students were to deduce the result of experiment by drawing the iodine test result of the variegated leaf shown earlier in the assignment. While teachers were not able to conduct face-to-face lessons in the laboratory during HBL, resources online and on SLS platform made the experiential learning possible and students&rsquo; learning is still complete with this virtual practical lesson.</li>
	</ol>
	
<p><strong>HBL Virtual Practical Lesson for Sec 1NT Science</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">Students were directed to this website:&nbsp;<a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc">https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc</a>for a virtual practical session, where students can learn to arrange the electrical components in a circuit. These online simulation has allowed students to observe the changes in current and voltage in parallel and series circuits, and in turn strengthen their understanding in the concepts.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;line-height:1.6;margin-top:10px;"><em>Screenshot of simulation used during HBL</em></p>

<p><strong>HBL for Sec 3NT Science</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">Besides the usual powerpoint slides and SLS lessons, students were asked to do some hands-on activities and a research for the topic of Electrical Safety:</p>
<ol>
	<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px; line-hegiht:2">To capture images of unsafe electrical practices/hazards at home and upload onto online platform to share with their classmates. Students actively looked out for samples at the comfort of their homes. Some samples are shown below. This activity has heightened the awareness of presence of unsafe electrical hazards at home and ways to eradicate such hazards.</li>
	
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/elct hazard.png" />
	
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px; line-height:2;"> As a follow-up exercise, students are to identify the electrical hazards from the source provided to evaluate their understanding.</li>
	
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/Sec 3NT Science electrical hazards source.jpg" />
<p  style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;margin-top:5px;"><em>Source containing electrical hazards</em></p>
	
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;line-height:2;"> To pique the interest and to empower them to explore beyond the textbook, the students conducted a simple research on electric eels to find out:
<ul style="margin-top:10px;">
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;">how electric eels generate electricity,</li>
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;">how the electrical eels do not get electrocuted,</li>
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;">how to protect oneself when one is faced with an electric eel.</li>
</ul>
	
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/sci11.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;margin-top:5px;"><em>Sample answers</em></p>
	
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;line-height:2;"> Online videos were also used as a source of learning in addition to the powerpoint slides. After watching the videos, they answer questions to reinforce their learning. Some online resources used were:</li>
<ul>
	
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc1wVdbVI0E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc1wVdbVI0E</a></li>
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF3OyQ3HwfU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF3OyQ3HwfU</a></li>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/sci12.jpg" /><p  style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;margin-top:5px;"><em>Sample answers</em></p>
	</ul>
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px; line-height:2;"> As a closure and consolidation to the lesson, students are to assess their learning via a crossword puzzle. This injected some fun element for students to summarise their learning for the chapter.
</li>
	</ol>

<p><strong>HBL Sec 3 Chemistry</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">The Salts chapter can be abstract and very dry and Chemistry students tend to struggle in visualizing, understanding and making sense of the multiple steps in preparing a salt. During HBL, students watch the videos uploaded by teachers to have a deeper understanding of the concepts.</p>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/sci13.jpg" />
<p  style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;margin-top:5px;"><em>Screenshot of Youtube video filmed as an educational tool for our students</em></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">The videos featured step-by-step explanation and visualization of the various preparation methods. Filmed by our very own chemistry teacher, these videos have value-added to the learning of this chapter even at home. Students can playback the video anytime for self-directed learning and fill up the blanks in the consolidation mind-maps. The students will be more ready for experiential learning in the lab when they are back in school.</p>

<p><strong>HBL Sec 3 Physics Lesson</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">Technology has allowed teachers to make abstract concepts more concrete for our students so that they understand better. Before full HBL, when learning about Kinematics, students were tasked to investigate the motion of the ball in a few scenarios. They used the Vernier Video Physics applet on iPads to track the trajectory of a ball.</p>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/Sec 3 Phy Trajectory pic.png" />
<p  style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;margin-top:5px;"><em>Students using the Vernier Video Physics applet on iPads to track the trajectory of a ball</em></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">After recording themselves and tracking the trajectory of the ball, students could view the displacement-time and velocity-time graphs of the ball throughout its entire motion. Students better understood how the graphs were drawn and the relationship between the two graphs.</p>

<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/Sec 3 Phy Trajectory Graph pic.png" />
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;margin-top:5px;"><em>Graphs showing the trajectory of a ball</em></p>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">During full HBL, to understand the Principle of Conservation of Energy better, energy cubes were used so that students could visualise abstract concepts better. A video was recorded to explain the principle, with the aid of energy cubes.</p>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/sci16.png" />
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;margin-top:5px;"><em>Screenshot of video to explain Conservation of Energy filmed by our Physics teacher</em></p>

<p><strong>HBL Sec 4 Biology Lesson on</strong><strong>Transport in Humans (Circulatory System)</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">Students role play as a team of medical interns in the Emergency Response Unit of Sengkang Hospital. A 66-year-old female was sent to the hospital because while on her way to the supermarket, she experienced chest pains, faintness and then she collapsed.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:10px;">
	<li style="font-size:16px;">
 <strong>Preliminary Diagnosis</strong></li>
<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2;margin-top:10px;">The team is given the patient&rsquo;s details and history, just like how it would be provided for in the hospital.</p>
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/sci17.png" />

<li style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Medical Report Analysis</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;margin-top:10px;">Students then are required to</p>
<ol>
	<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;line-height:2"> analyse the results of three diagnostic tests: a) MRI scan of the patient's heart, b) angiogram of the patient's coronary arteries, and c) blood smear,</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;line-height:2"> determine the cause of your patient's condition based on the evidence provided to you and</p>
<li style="margin-left: 20px; font-size:15px;line-height:2"> account for all signs and symptoms according to your diagnosis.</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">All the pictures shown provided a more engaging and relevant learning experience for the students. Furthermore, the students are actually already equipped with the knowledge and skills to solve the problem, thus the lesson serves to be an extension to the content learnt in the subject.</p>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/sci18.png" />

<p style="font-size:15px; line-height:2">Students then answer the following free response questions, which are part of the process of medical diagnosis. Students are then tasked to comment on the diagnosis and explanation in their respective groups, via Student Learning Spaces (SLS). These learning experiences provided a more authentic context to the students and will in turn make the learning more enduring.</p>
