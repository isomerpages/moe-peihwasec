<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-weight:bold">Our Vision</h4>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">To add value to each student's potential in Mathematics.</p>


<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-weight:bold">Our Mission</h4>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">To equip our students with Mathematical skills, processes and concepts, as well as the metacognitive skills to appreciate Mathematics. These will empower them to become problem-solvers who will make sound decisions and be critical thinkers, life-long learners and contributors of society.</p>



<h4 style="color:#635f1a;font-weight:bold">Our Goals</h4>
<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:Open Sans">The Department aims to provide the students with the necessary skills not only to pass examinations but also to enjoy learning Mathematics. Hence, we let the students explore Mathematics beyond the confines of the textbooks through the use of manipulative, experiential education, quizzes, enrichment programmes, online learning and mathematics competitions. As Mathematics is the key to many areas in our lives, we hope to equip our students with a good foundation in Mathematics so that they would become competent and life-long learners.</p>
