<h4><strong>Our Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To add value to each student&rsquo;s potential in Mathematics.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To equip our&nbsp;students&nbsp;with Mathematical skills, processes and concepts, as well as the metacognitive skills to appreciate Mathematics. These will empower them to become problem-solvers who will make sound decisions and be critical thinkers, life-long learners and contributors of society.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Our Goals</strong></h4>
<p>The Department aims to provide the&nbsp;students&nbsp;with the necessary skills not only to pass examinations but also to enjoy learning Mathematics. Hence, we let the&nbsp;students&nbsp;explore&nbsp;Mathematics beyond the confines of the textbooks through the use of manipulative, experiential education, quizzes, enrichment programmes, online learning and&nbsp;mathematics competitions. As Mathematics is the key to many areas in our lives, we hope to equip our students&nbsp;with a good foundation in Mathematics so that they&nbsp;would become competent and life-long learners.</p>
