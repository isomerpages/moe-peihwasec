<img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isomerpages/moe-peihwasec/staging/images/Homepage/(3)%20learning%20for%20life%20programme%20%E2%80%93%20community%20youth%20leadership.png">

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Pei Hwa Secondary School was established in January 2005.  The school gets inspiration from the Pei Hwa Foundation, which is made up of alumni of the former Pei Hwa Public School. Every year, students at Pei Hwa Secondary receive bursaries and scholarships provided by the Foundation. These bursaries and scholarships, especially for the less privileged students, help them make the best of every opportunity that comes their way.
<br><br>
The school was officially opened on 28 July 2007 by then Minister for Education (and our current President) Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam. During the opening ceremony, the school’s time capsule comprising its first set of memorabilia – such as its uniform, handbook, music score of the school song, and newsletter – was sealed. It will be opened during the school’s silver jubilee celebration in 2030. The school also launched the Jalan Kayu Heritage Trail to preserve the history of the neighbouring community as part of its official opening. This trail was later identified as one of the SG50 heritage trails. Over the years, the school has developed various platforms to provide a holistic and engaging educational experience for its students, including place-based learning at Punggol River as part of School Curriculum Innovation (which has since been integrated and renamed as Project Work in 2019) and the biennial public performance PHiesta first held in 2009. <br><br>In 2011, the school launched the inaugural biennial Community Day as part of the students’ Service Learning Experience.<br><br>
In 2014, Pei Hwa was one of the 12 pilot schools to implement Subject-Based Banding (SBB). The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is in Robotics and Programming, with a science, technology, engineering and mathematics focus. Its Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is in Community Youth Leadership, titled ‘PRIDE of the Community: Developing Altruists’. 
<br><br>
In 2018, the school integrated its ALP and LLP in a new Project Work curriculum. The school launched its inaugural Open House and also saw the completion of the indoor sports hall.
<br><br>In 2019, the school broadened its Internationalisation Programme with the collaboration with partner schools in Bangkok and Hanoi. In 2020, Pei Hwa was one of 24 pilot schools to implement Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB). The school was also recognised as the Zonal Lead School for Makers’ Education.
<br><br>
2023, the school refreshed its Vision, Mission and Values, with the aim of developing <strong style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Future-Ready Learners and Forward-Looking Leaders </strong> who have the <u style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">zest to learn, the dare to innovate and the heart to lead and serve.</u> The school also repositioned its project work curriculum as the Future Leaders Programme.<br><br>
With a strong emphasis on developing innovation and resilience, the school continues to play a pivotal role in moulding the future of its students. Pei Hwa Secondary School's history is a testament to its enduring legacy in providing holistic and quality education to our youths.
