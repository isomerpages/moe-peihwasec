<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description"> <strong style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2; font-family:sans-serif;">Pei Hwa Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) </strong>offers our students the opportunity to engage in a wide range of outdoor activities and training programmes that are designed to develop their skills and inspire them to achieve their full potential. Through outdoor experiences, we aim to instill values such as perseverance and discipline, while also fostering an appreciation for nature and our urban surroundings.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description">Our club is open to students who are willing to step out of their comfort zones and challenge themselves. Through a series of tasks and challenges, our members learn to work together as a team and to innovate in order to solve problems effectively. This often requires them to learn to adapt and communicate well with each other, allowing them to develop important soft skills while also earning certificates for their achievements.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description">At ODAC, we are committed to exploring options that help our students develop important outdoor skills in a holistic manner. Guided by our motto <strong style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2; font-family:sans-serif;">"One for All, All for One"</strong>, we are proud to be one big family that celebrates and embraces each other's differences. Overall, ODAC offers an excellent opportunity for students to grow and learn in a supportive and challenging environment.

	"I can confidently say that my journey in Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) was one of the best times in my life. ODAC has changed my lifestyle completely and in an amazing way. In Sec 1, I was an introvert and was unsure if I made the right choice signing up. However, from the moment I joined ODAC, I was welcomed with open arms and treated with care. That was the first time that ODAC was introduced to me, One For All, All For One. I understood then that ODAC was not just a CCA, but a family. Each session is a fun and thrilling experience as they incorporated practical outdoor skills, exercise and bonding games. The practical skills have prepared us for the outdoor elements and taught us basic skills such as first-aid, knot tying, and even activities such as kayaking, orienteering and rock climbing that has helped overcome my fears. The fitness component is to help our members obtain and maintain a healthy physique as well as good mental health. Lastly, the bonding games is meant to strengthen the bond between our members such as building teamwork and cooperation, communication, shared experiences, and much more. Initially, I was not very comfortable and confident in these activities, unsure if I could even do them. My worries soon seemed pointless as my seniors and peers supported and motivated me throughout, allowing me to reach my full potential. It was the same case when I was applying for the President position. They gave me confidence and I would not have had the privilege to be the President if it were not for them. It is not easy being the President especially since the expectations are high. However, I did not give up and find joy in performing my duties. I have taken many risks throughout my time in ODAC and I am glad I have taken them as they have made me the person I am today. Know that the only impossible journey is the one you never begin."

	"ODAC has given me a rare opportunity to be able to lead a CCA. My role being Vice President of programme. This experience has been a spectacular journey for me and I hope the fun will not stop even after I graduate from this school and this wonderful CCA. Although it was hard for me to adapt to the high physical demands and requirements of ODAC at first, my seniors were kind and patient with me and gave me advice on how to improve my physique in order to be able to enjoy the CCA to its fullest extent! Although leading a CCA of this size has its tough points, I still enjoy performing my role to plan activities for ODAC. The end-of-year camps and the competitions I have participated in has always made me feel included and I have enjoyed myself thoroughly!<br><br>

	"My overall experience in ODAC has been a rollercoaster ride. At first, I had to grapple with the strenuous and arduous activities in the CCA as well as the feeling of being constantly left out due to the fact that I am the only girl in my cohort. Of course, I had the initial intention of changing my CCA but as soon as I befriended my girl seniors, things became slightly brighter and I decided to give ODAC a chance, hoping that it would be better in the future. Thankfully, in the course of time, my experiences has become more enjoyable. From the wide range of activities that were planned and organised, I have managed to experience many new and wonderful adventures. Through all the different and exhilarating experiences, I feel that the CCA brings us closer together, strengthens our bonds, let’s us loosen up and have fun, all while teaching us useful skills, outdoors and indoors, plus the moral and core values that we, as a CCA, have to uphold together. Other than bringing laughter and joy in most of the sessions, ODAC has also taught me key values. For instance, our motto, “One for All, All for One” really emphasises the context that we stick together, regardless of any situation and represents our unity, how we are always there for one another, supporting each other. Resilience, discipline and teamwork are some of the many values that I have garnered from my journey so far in ODAC due to the challenges that we have to face together as a team as well as the consequences that come with it. All in all, my experience in ODAC has been filled with memories. By choosing to stay in this ambitious CCA, I have engaged in many enriching activities, participated in thrilling events, worked with fun and friendly people, stepped out of my comfort zone, overcome obstacles, gained numerous life skills, learnt meaningful values and learnt to appreciate the flora and fauna. I definitely do not regret giving this CCA a chance. Had I not, I would not have found myself a new family."
