<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description">At <strong style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2; font-family:sans-serif;">Pei Hwa Basketball</strong>, we take great pride in our rigorous training programme which is designed to nurture the talents of our students and inspire them to achieve their potential. We firmly believe that discipline and determination are essential qualities for success, and we strive to instill these values in our students as they pursue their passion for basketball</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description">Our basketball CCA is dedicated to improve teamwork and communication in our students, enabling them to perform their best during basketball trainings and competitions. Through trainings, students’ physical and mental capacities are enhanced, allowing them to develop better decision-making skills. Students also learn important skills like coordination, balance, and body control, which are essential for success on the basketball court. Students will also develop other important values such as resilience, respect and self-discipline through weekly training sessions, friendly matches and National School Games.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description">Every year is a fresh start for us. Each student will have an opportunity to represent the school to play for National School Games. At Pei Hwa Basketball, we are proud to say that we are one big family, united by a group of like-minded students who enjoy playing basketball.</p>

<img align="left" src="/images/CCA/basketballtestimonial01.png" style="width: 23%; border-radius: 7%;  margin-right:15px;">"My time in the CCA has shaped me into a more resilient, determined, and confident individual. Firstly, the dedication, expertise, and passion of my coach and teachers for the sport have fostered a supportive and encouraging environment that has allowed me to grow as a player. Their guidance and coaching have helped me to improve my skills and reach new levels of performance for the sport. Moreover, the CCA has given me the privilege of playing alongside talented and driven seniors and teammates who share the same love for the game. Through many hours of training and competing together, we have formed strong friendships and created unforgettable memories. Through the training, our physical conditioning, mental resilience, and understanding of the game have improved as well. These few years in my CCA have not only improved my basketball skills but have also instilled valuable life lessons such as discipline, perseverance, and leadership."

	"In my one and a half years of basketball CCA so far, my passion for basketball has been growing. Through my time in the basketball CCA, I have gotten to know many different types of people from all walks of life who share the same passion and love for the game of basketball. I enjoy almost every minute of basketball CCA, from the warmups, the drills and even the tactics my coach has set for the team to learn. I have made so many friends along the way as well. In addition, my CCA teachers in charge and coaches have really groomed me as a player and as a captain for the C Division basketball team as well, allowing me to take on a greater leadership role and nurturing my leadership capabilities. As a C Division captain, I feel that I play an important role in shaping my team and influencing them as well."
