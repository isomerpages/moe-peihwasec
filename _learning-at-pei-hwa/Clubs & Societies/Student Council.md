<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description">The Student Council is the bridge between the student body and the school. The Student Council seeks to contribute to building a caring and enabling school environment where student voice matters. The promotion of student voice helps students feel respected; students feel a stronger sense of agency and they believe that they can be a changemaker to make a difference; and students feel an increased sense of belonging to the school. </p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2 ;margin-top:0px; font-family:sans-serif;" class="description">The Student Council facilitates the inclusion of student voice in some of the decision-making in the school. They do it through calling for suggestions on various areas in school through Student Forums or submission of online forms and conducting polls based on suggestions from the ground. After receiving these responses, they seek to better understand the perspectives of their schoolmates and the considerations from the school. They apply the design thinking approach to problem-solving, then propose possible solutions and ideas to the school leaders. Some of the projects which they have undertaken include changes to the school bell, school jacket, graduation prom and canteen rejuvenation project.</p>
