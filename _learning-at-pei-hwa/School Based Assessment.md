<p>In meeting the challenges of an increasingly complex world, the Ministry
of Education (MOE) has, in recent years, announced changes to School-Based
Assessments to help our students discover more joy in learning and to develop
them to become lifelong learners. This year, the school continues to make
changes to our school-based assessments to create time and space for teachers
and students to achieve that.</p>
