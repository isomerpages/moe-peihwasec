<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px;font-family:sans-serif;">In Pei Hwa, we provide support to students and prioritise studentsâ€™ well-being by catering to
their individual needs.</p>

<h5 style="color:#635f1a;font-family:sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">1. Student Development Team and Tiered Support System for Students</h5>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">The Student Development Team (SDT) oversees the character development and holistic learning experiences of the students.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">The SDT comprises two Year Heads, two Assistant Year Heads, Head of Department (HOD)/Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), HOD/Student Management and Subject
Head (SH)/Student Well-being. Together, they collaborate in fostering a culture of care and providing a holistic learning experience for the students. The team also employs a structured referral and support system to address the varied learning and behavioural needs of the
students.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">The Tiered System of Support is a comprehensive whole-school framework that utilises and assesses data regarding students' performance and progress to determine their specific needs and the level of support they require. The framework is employed to guide and provide support
in both academic and non-academic domains.</p>
