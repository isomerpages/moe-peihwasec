<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px;font-family:sans-serif;">In Pei Hwa, we provide support to students and prioritise students’ well-being by catering to
their individual needs.</p>

<h5 style="color:#635f1a;font-family:sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">1. Student Development Team and Tiered Support System for Students</h5>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">The Student Development Team (SDT) oversees the character development and holistic learning experiences of the students.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">The SDT comprises two Year Heads, two Assistant Year Heads, Head of Department (HOD)/Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), HOD/Student Management and Subject
Head (SH)/Student Well-being. Together, they collaborate in fostering a culture of care and providing a holistic learning experience for the students. The team also employs a structured referral and support system to address the varied learning and behavioural needs of the
students.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">The Tiered System of Support is a comprehensive whole-school framework that utilises and assesses data regarding students' performance and progress to determine their specific needs and the level of support they require. The framework is employed to guide and provide support
in both academic and non-academic domains.</p>

<h5 style="color:#635f1a;font-family:sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">2. Counselling</h5>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Pei Hwa recognizes the importance of nurturing a healthy and positive social-emotional well- being for our students. This is essential for them to pursue and thrive in their academic functioning, as well as to achieve other key developmental milestones in their lives. The school counseling team works closely in partnership with teachers, parents, and external partners to equip students with relevant knowledge and skills. This is done to develop them as individuals with a healthy sense of self-identity and social competencies, enabling them to build positive relationships and make responsible choices.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">The Counselling Process</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin:-15px 0 13px 0px;font-family:sans-serif;">Counselling is a therapeutic relationship between the trained school counsellor and the student. One fundamental goal of counselling is to help the student develop a better understanding of themselves and gain insights into issues they might be facing. Through this process, the student
is empowered to gradually build up their readiness to identify and acknowledge their areas of concerns and work towards a commitment for positive change.</p> 

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">To create a safe and trusting space for the student, the school counsellor is bounded by a set of
professional ethics to maintain confidentiality of matters discussed during counselling sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:15.5px;"><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Areas that the school counsellor provide support on include but not limited by:</strong></p>
