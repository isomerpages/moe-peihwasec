<p style="2;margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">MOE has identified competencies that have become increasingly important in the 21st Century. These competencies, represented in the following framework, underpin the holistic education that our schools provide to better prepare our students for the future. With the use of technology, the students adopt various methodologies and approaches in their learning. For example, students carry out inquisitive learning skills and problem-solving skills through the use of educational technology.</p>

<p style="2;margin-top:15px;font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;font-family:sans-serif;">Pei Hwa Secondary aligns all our academic and non-academic programs according to 21st century competencies, our school have carried out short ICT courses for the pupils to ensure that they meet these standards.

Together, these competencies will enable our young to capitalise on the rich opportunities of the new digital age, while keeping a strong Singapore heartbeat.</p>
