<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">We believe that leadership is an acquirable set of skills and abilities that can be fostered and cultivated within our students. We adopt The Leadership Challenge as our training model for student leadership development. The 5 practices of exemplary leadership from The Leadership Challenge help to guide and develop student leaders with the skills that they need to be Forward-Looking leaders.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">The student leadership development in Pei Hwa Secondary School is part of the school’s <a href="https://www.peihwasec.moe.edu.sg/school-distinctive-programme/learning-for-life-programme-community-youth-leadership-llp-cyl/" style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:1.5;font-family:sans-serif;font-weight:bold;text-decoration: none;">Learning for
Life Programme (LLP) in Community Youth Leadership</a>. The development of student leaders takes on a tiered-approach with the training programmes and empowerment opportunities specially catered to the different tiers and levels. </p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">Tier 1 student leaders refer to all students. At Tier 1, students do not need to hold a leadership position or title. Level-wide training programmes are conducted for Tier 1 student leaders to equip them with leadership knowledge and skills which they can apply in their daily lives, in and out of school as well as curricular and non-curricular contexts. The focus of the training is progressive and incremental over the students’ 4 to 5 years in Pei Hwa Secondary School.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">Tier 2 student leaders include Class Leaders, Peer Support Leaders and CCA Executive Committee members while Tier 3 student leaders include Student Councillors ,CCA Chairpersons and Vice Chairpersons. For Tier 2 and 3 Student Leaders, there are general leadership development programmes, role-specific training programmes and mentorship to equip them for their leadership roles.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">We have a variety of programmes aimed at developing our students as Forward-Looking Leaders. Some programmes are targeted to equip students to fulfil specific roles while some seek to equip them with leadership skills which are commonly required across the different leadership roles.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">Role-specific training platforms include class committee trainings, peer support training, CCA leaders’ training and Student Council meetings. Student leaders are equipped with role-specific knowledge and skills to lead their peers and carry out their responsibilities.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">Some general leadership development programmes include the Sec 2 Basic Leadership Camp, the Sec 3 Advanced Leadership Camp and other external leadership events or programmes. Through these programmes, student leaders are trained to apply The Leadership Challenge model as a leader. They are also equipped with knowledge and skills in problem-solving, facilitation, communication and project
management.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">Student leaders are also mentored by teachers in charge of the class, various programmes and the leadership groups. Teachers help the student leaders to extend their learning by guiding them in
applying what they have learnt, providing constructive feedback and supporting them in reflective practices.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">
Through the leadership opportunities available in school, we hope to develop student leaders who have a <strong style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2; font-family:sans-serif">heart to lead and serve others</strong>. All student leaders are encouraged to empathise with others and to believe that they can be a positive changemaker in the context of their family, class, CCA, school, the community and even the world.
