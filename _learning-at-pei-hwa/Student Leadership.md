<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2; font-family:sans-serif">In Pei Hwa Secondary School, we believe that all students can be and should be developed as <strong style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2; font-family:sans-serif">Forward-Looking Leaders</strong>. We hope to develop our student leaders to be <strong style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2; font-family:sans-serif">confident communicators, effective collaborators, active and empathetic contributors</strong> as well as <strong style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2; font-family:sans-serif">innovative changemakers</strong>. We are committed to equipping all our students with knowledge and skills to be effective leaders in different areas of their lives.

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">We believe that leadership is an acquirable set of skills and abilities that can be fostered and cultivated within our students. We adopt The Leadership Challenge as our training model for student leadership development. The 5 practices of exemplary leadership from The Leadership Challenge help to guide and develop student leaders with the skills that they need to be forward-looking leaders.</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">The student leadership development in Pei Hwa Secondary School is part of the school’s LLP in Community Youth Leadership (insert link to LLP webpage). The development of student leaders takes on a tiered-approach with the training programmes and empowerment opportunities specially catered to the different tiers and levels. </p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">Tier 1 student leaders refer to all students. At Tier 1, students do not need to hold a leadership position or title. Level-wide training programmes are conducted for Tier 1 student leaders to equip them with leadership knowledge and skills which they can apply in daily living, in and outside of school as well as during curricular and non-curricular contexts. The focus of the training is progressive and incremental over the students’ 4 to 5 years in Pei Hwa Secondary School</p>

<p style="font-size:14.5px; line-height:2;margin-top:15px; font-family:sans-serif">Tier 2 student leaders include Class leaders, Peer Support Leaders and CCA Executive Committee members while Tier 3 student leaders include Student Councillors ,CCA Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons. For Tier 2 and 3 Student Leaders, there are general leadership development programmes, role-specific training programmes and mentorship to equip them for their leadership roles.</p>

			<td style="font-family:sans-serif;margin-bottom:5px;">
The Student Council aims to develop innovative, daring and compassionate leaders. As Tier 3 Student Leaders, the Student Council is the voice of the student body and takes the lead in school events and improving student welfare. Student Councillors are also advocates of the environment by raising awareness about environment conservation through events such as Earth Week.
						<br><br>
						Every year, Student Councillors are officially appointed during the Student Leaders Investiture. As role-models of the student population, Student Councillors lead by example. They are given multiple platforms to develop their leadership and event management skills through organising events such as the Teachers’ Day Celebration and Secondary 1 Orientation, as well as managing the PHun Lounge (Student Activity Center). Through reflection of their experiences, the Student Councillors are equipped with knowledge on leadership, teamwork and project management.
